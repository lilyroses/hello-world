# hello-world
My first repository, as created per the github 'hello-world repository' tutorial


I am 25 years old. I am teaching myself, with the help of free resources such as Harvard's CS50x online course, SoloLearn (for Python 3 and Java), the Reddit forums r/learnprogramming (for Python 3, Java, and general programming help) along with PowerShell, Bash, and Linux/Unix tutorials - I'm borrowing a friend's laptop for some work, but most is done from my Android phone, so I'm trying to make do with the likes of the SoloLearn, edx, reddit mobile apps - along with some other great utils like Termux, PyDroid, QDroid, DroidEdit, and BusyBox. My short term goals are of course to become proficient in each of the areas I am discovering, but also to implement creative, useful, and unique solutions to the unique problems and situations I encounter. For example, I would like to be able to dual-boot my computer so that I can run a Linux flavor - I'm probably going to go with Kali - alongside Windows 10, but I'd also like to be able to have a separate partition for Android development if possible. I'd also like to root my Android, create SSH connections between my devices, and figure out what the vulnerabilites are in each of my devices/networks so that I may reinforce and protect them. Lastly, I'm working my way through the first of the OverTheWire WarGames, called bandit.io, which is a hacking game devoted to teaching players the basics of SSH protocols and the ways in which their vulnerabilites can be exploited. 

I'd like to be able to complete college in the future, but for now, this is the best I can do.
